    -clone the repo
        local: is on your computer
        remote: Github (the cloud)
    -cd into the repo
    -make a file (touch filename with extensions)
     -naming conventions are lowercase, no spaces, use dashes between words
     -added content to file
     -added PAT authentifcation (generated a new personal authentifcation token on github)
LOCAL ---> REMOTE
    - git status  :exact command, displays status
    - git add filename.ext : make sure to put the extension in the filename
    -git commit -m " initial commit" : will not commit if message is not present
    - git push origin branchname : set up to merge and replace older version with newest version
